# Arabic-Audio-Emotion-Classifiers
Introduction

1- Use case

Emotion expression is an essential part of human interaction. The same text can hold different meanings when expressed with different emotions. Thus understanding the text alone is not enough for getting the meaning of an utterance. Acted and natural corpora have been used to detect emotions from speech. Many speech databases for different languages including English, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, Swedish and Spanish exist for modeling emotion recognition.

Arabic does not have an established natural audio emotion detector, so this is still a novel problem yet to be solved.

Emotion detectors for natural audio can be used in other applications like voice assistants, which can use the information derived from them to better serve the user depending on his/her mood. They can also be used in automated answering systems, which can help automatically determine the satisfaction of a customer calling a support line.

2- Justification of the use case choice

I am Tunisian (a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa): Arabic is my mother tongue(with French), I remain fascinated by the Arabic language and wanted to apply my knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Arabic to build an emotion classifier.
